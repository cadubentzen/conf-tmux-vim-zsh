# Configuration files for Oh-my-zsh, Tmux and Vim

This repository contains my configuration files for Oh-my-zsh, Tmux and Vim, just in order to make my life easier when migrating to another computer.

## Installation

#### Ubuntu

```
$ sudo make download 
$ make install
```

## TODO
- Currently, Ubuntu is detected via `ifeq ($(UNAME),Linux)`, change this later to detect more distros such as Arch Linux.
